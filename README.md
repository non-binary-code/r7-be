# R7: Making Zero Waste Possible (Backend Repo)

**Front End Hosted on [Heroku](https://non-binary-code-r7.netlify.app/)  
List of All API Endpoints on [Heroku](https://r7-api-athena.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html)  
Product Demonstration on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Deeo_B-Es)**  

## Rationale

Our rationale is simple: To connect people who have things they no longer need, with people who need them. Doing this, we can reduce waste and we can help people avoid spending money during this cost of living crisis.

## User Interface

### Design

A standard C# .NET6 RESTful API using Swagger for documentation, Serilog for logging, Dapper as the ORM framework, PostgreSQL as the database and Docker for containerisation, hosted in Heroku.

## Creating A Local Copy

### ✔️ 1. CLONE THE REPO
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) 

Terminal Commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/non-binary-code/r7-be.git
```

### ✔️ 2. USAGE
![Visual Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio-5C2D91.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio&logoColor=white) ![.Net](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-5C2D91?style=for-the-badge&logo=.net&logoColor=white) ![Swagger](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Swagger-%23Clojure?style=for-the-badge&logo=swagger&logoColor=white)

To run this API, compile and run it in Visual Studio. This will automatically launch the API and load the Swagger page in your default browser.

This project requires the .NET6 framework.

## Non-Binary Code

Non-Binary Code are [Dane Whitfield](https://github.com/danewhitfield), [Galina Ostroumova](https://github.com/ostroumova), [Jason Clifton](https://github.com/JasonClifton), [Yousef Ajdabiya](https://github.com/YousefToast) and [Zan Clifton](https://github.com/ZanClifton). For a collection of well used and tired out objects given a fresh coat of coding paint, they rub together pretty well!
